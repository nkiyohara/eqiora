# Execution, diagnostics, and arrays

## One run lifecycle

Blocking and awaitable execution use the same native worker, state machine,
and once-materialized result:

```python
field = model.field(model.field_ids[0])
plan = eqiora.resolve(
    model,
    temporal=eqiora.time.Tsitouras45(
        initial_step_s=0.01,
        relative_tolerance=1.0e-9,
        absolute_tolerances={field: 1.0e-11},
    ),
)
state = eqiora.State.initial(plan)
run = eqiora.submit(
    plan,
    state=state,
    until_s=1.0,
    output_times_s=(1.0,),
)
print(run.status, run.progress)
result = run.result()

# The blocking convenience uses the same lifecycle.
same_kind_of_result = eqiora.run(
    plan,
    state=state,
    until_s=1.0,
    output_times_s=(1.0,),
)
```

`RunStatus` records a finite accepted history from creation through one
terminal state. `progress` is an execution-family-specific coalesced snapshot,
not a percentage or event log. Repeated `result()` calls return the same
immutable Python result object.

Awaiting does not introduce another native runtime:

```python
async def simulate(plan):
    run = eqiora.submit(
        plan,
        state=eqiora.State.initial(plan),
        until_s=1.0,
        output_times_s=(1.0,),
    )
    try:
        return await run
    finally:
        if not run.done:
            run.cancel()
```

Cancelling the surrounding asyncio task and dropping a Run do not implicitly
cancel native work. Call `run.cancel()` explicitly. Cancellation is
cooperative at accepted execution boundaries, publishes typed cancellation
evidence, and never exposes a partial result. A request after the last
cancellable boundary may still complete.

Long native waits release the ordinary CPython GIL only after inputs are
owned. Solver iterations do not call Python. Free-threaded Python and
subinterpreter shutdown remain separate capabilities.

## Structured failures

Eqiora model and execution failures derive from `EqioraError`. Stable
subclasses distinguish validation, compatibility, capability, execution,
cancellation, and internal failures. Every Eqiora-raised error retains
structured diagnostics:

```python
try:
    result = eqiora.run(
        plan,
        state=eqiora.State.initial(plan),
        until_s=-1.0,
        output_times_s=(-1.0,),
    )
except eqiora.EqioraError as error:
    print(error.category)
    for diagnostic in error.diagnostics:
        print(diagnostic.code, diagnostic.severity, diagnostic.message)
        print(diagnostic.graph_path, diagnostic.source_span)
```

Python call-shape mistakes remain ordinary `TypeError` rather than fabricated
model diagnostics. Guarded native boundaries sanitize unwinding Rust panics as
`InternalError`; process abort and memory exhaustion are not recoverable
claims.

## NumPy ownership

An `Array` owns a dense, native-endian, rank-one CPU `float64` allocation.
Inspecting descriptors does not import NumPy.

```python
array = result["x"].values
view = array.numpy(copy=False)  # `None` has the same meaning
writable = array.numpy(copy=True)

assert not view.flags.writeable
assert writable.flags.writeable
```

The first no-copy projection transfers the native allocation once into an
opaque owner. The resulting C-contiguous NumPy array is irreversibly read-only
and remains alive independently of the Result and Array handles. `copy=True`
returns an independent writable allocation.

## DLPack

Eqiora exports an independent versioned CPU snapshot:

```python
import numpy as np

snapshot = np.from_dlpack(array)
```

The snapshot never aliases immutable result evidence. Legacy capsule requests,
non-CPU transfers, non-`None` streams, and `copy=False` fail closed because
consumer enforcement of DLPack's advisory read-only flag is not universal.

Differentiable-program inputs may arrive from a complete CPU:0 DLPack
producer. Eqiora requests a no-transfer view, validates dtype, rank, length,
byte order, alignment, and contiguity, then makes one documented owned staging
copy before native execution. This is not a zero-copy execution-input claim.
GPU streams, sparse/distributed arrays, and general Run inputs remain separate
contracts.
