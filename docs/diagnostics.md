# Diagnostic code registry

Diagnostic codes are append-only and are never reused for a different
condition. Public APIs return structured `Diagnostic` values rather than bare
strings.

| Range | Area |
|---|---|
| `EQ00xx` | Infrastructure and feature availability |
| `EQ01xx` | Graph nodes, edges, transactions, and provenance |
| `EQ02xx` | Standard Ontology named subgraphs |
| `EQ03xx` | Semantic definitions, expressions, and clocks |
| `EQ04xx` | Units and dimensions |
| `EQ05xx` | Reference execution and numerical approximation |
| `EQ06xx` | Eqiora Language lexing, parsing, names, and static types |
| `EQ07xx` | Semantic/Operator IR lowering and evaluation |
| `EQ08xx` | Numerical realization and solver kernels |
| `EQ09xx` | Serialized artifacts, manifests, and content identity |
