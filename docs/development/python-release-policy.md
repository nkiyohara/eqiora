# Python distribution policy

This policy governs Python distribution artifacts. It does not widen Eqiora's
scientific or numerical claims, and a successful package upload is not
mathematical verification.

## Release identity

The Cargo workspace package version is the sole authored Eqiora version. The
public Rust `eqiora::VERSION`, private native-module version, public Python
`eqiora.__version__`, sdist, wheel metadata, and installed distribution all
derive from it. The first alpha maps Cargo `0.1.0-alpha.1` to normalized Python
`0.1.0a1` and therefore to exact annotated tag `v0.1.0a1`; Python metadata must
not repeat an authored version. Publication requires the exact annotated tag
derived by prefixing `v` to the normalized Python version obtained from the sole
Cargo workspace version. A candidate records that expected tag, the full source
commit, and every source and wheel artifact by filename and SHA-256, and rejects
identity drift before publication.

The first wheel family is deliberately narrow:

- ordinary-GIL CPython 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14;
- Linux x86-64 with a `manylinux_2_17` compatibility floor;
- one per-CPython wheel, because the NumPy C API is not an `abi3` claim.

macOS, Windows, other architectures, musllinux, free-threaded CPython, `abi3`,
GPU runtimes, bundled MPI, Conda, and system packages graduate independently
after installed-artifact evidence.

## Candidate construction and acceptance

A candidate is accepted only from a clean source commit. The release gate:

1. builds the source distribution;
2. rebuilds every wheel from that source distribution, not the checkout;
3. checks the declared wheel tags and metadata;
4. installs each wheel into an isolated environment outside the source tree;
5. runs exact Gmsh 4.15.2 meshing plus the base, NumPy ownership,
   async/cancellation, typing, PyTorch, JAX, Matplotlib, and exact CPython 3.13
   Notebook profiles within their declared boundaries;
6. replays the public base quick start on every wheel and the public framework
   quick starts on the exact framework interpreter before upload;
7. verifies NumPy 2.1.0 separately on CPython 3.12 while retaining the ordinary
   latest-resolution profiles;
8. rebuilds the private Notebook frontend twice with exact Node 24.18.1 and
   npm 11.16.0 in distinct home-backed scratch directories and records the
   canonical detached H2 receipt; and
9. records source identity, artifact hashes, build-tool versions, the observed
   NumPy floor, and passing profiles in the candidate manifest.

Artifact construction, wheel inspection, interpreter resolution, and shared
input hashing form one barrier. The immutable artifact family is then consumed
by isolated validation profiles under the verification lane's CPU and memory
budget. Each profile owns its environment, consumer tree, temporary directory,
and log. Heavy framework profiles do not overlap one another, but may overlap a
fitting light profile. All admitted work is joined; receipts and diagnostics are
merged in the frozen logical profile order, and the shared artifact family and
extracted source are re-hashed before the manifest is written. A profile may
therefore neither publish partial success nor mutate another profile's input.

Candidate and aggregate-gate scratch space is rooted below the invoking user's
home directory, including when the ambient system temporary directory points
at `/tmp`. The candidate admits a bounded internal 2-CPU, 4096-MiB profile
sub-budget; explicit candidate-specific environment settings may narrow or
raise it when the enclosing execution environment has been provisioned to
match.

The standard `release-tools` dependency group in `pyproject.toml` owns the exact
reviewed `uv` and Twine versions, and Dependabot's `uv` ecosystem proposes
upgrades to that source. Candidate execution neither trusts nor rejects an
ambient `uv`: it installs the declared binary wheel once below
`~/.cache/eqiora/tools/uv/`, validates the resulting executable, and reuses that
versioned cache entry. Updating either reviewed tool is an ordinary dependency
change followed by the complete distribution gate; a floating `latest` never
enters candidate identity.

Registered host evidence builds this complete candidate once for one source
commit and platform. The distribution, typing, PyTorch, JAX, and Matplotlib
validations then require their own closed check groups from that same manifest
and wheel family. The distinct evidence cases share one exact aggregate target,
so the verification runner may execute the target once while retaining a
report for each case. The focused adapter scripts remain developer diagnostics;
they are not a second candidate identity and may rebuild during standalone use.

N1 candidates use `eqiora.python-distribution-candidate/v3`. Selection is
fail-closed across the complete sdist, four-wheel family, requested profiles,
checks, and manifest: any native display hook, private presentation/frontend
path, anywidget dependency, `notebook` extra/profile, Notebook check, or
frontend schema requires v3. The v2 reader remains only for complete candidate
families with none of those signals. Every v3 wheel declares exactly
`anywidget==0.11.0` behind the `notebook` extra and carries the same three
nonempty private assets.

The canonical H2 receipt is retained beside the candidate manifest, outside
the publishable artifact directory. Its detached SHA-256 binds the exact
source commit, complete sdist/wheel inventory, lock graph, generated assets,
license notices, Node/npm/browser identity, and resolved Python host
environment. It proves only byte equality between the two declared frontend
builds and the committed wheel assets in that exact environment. The manifest
remains provenance for one artifact set; neither v3 nor H2 claims reproducible
distribution bytes, signatures, or equality on another machine.

Build into an empty directory outside the source tree:

```bash
python3 tools/release/python_candidate.py --out <candidate-directory>
```

The development-only `--skip-extras` mode may shorten iteration, but its
manifest is not eligible for upload. Add `--require-tag` at the publication
gate.

TestPyPI is the staging boundary. Upload uses a dedicated trusted-publishing
identity with the minimum OIDC permission and a protected release environment.
Hosted automation is transport for that upload, never the merge-quality gate.
The exact TestPyPI artifacts must be installed by version in clean
environments and replay the documented quick starts before promotion. A
TestPyPI upload, tag selection, or production PyPI release requires maintainer
release authority; ordinary feature work does not imply it.

## Dependencies and extras

NumPy is the only mandatory Python runtime dependency. Exact `gmsh==4.15.2` is
the optional `gmsh` extra and is launched only by the admitted automatic
meshing path; separating it preserves the base package's `manylinux_2_17`
floor. The Linux Gmsh wheel also requires `libGLU.so.1`. PyTorch, JAX,
Matplotlib, and anywidget remain optional extras, and importing the base
package must neither require nor import any of them. The public `notebook` extra contains only exact
`anywidget==0.11.0`; JupyterLab, marimo, Playwright, and Chromium are verified
host/build inputs and do not become Eqiora runtime dependencies.
The first Matplotlib adapter uses exact release 3.11.1 with the headless Agg
backend. Its registered adapter profile runs on ordinary-GIL CPython 3.13;
the other wheel interpreters are not Matplotlib adapter compatibility
evidence. A wider compatibility range requires separate boundary evidence.

Dependency ranges are compatibility claims. Widening one requires an installed
wheel test at the new boundary; changing an exact framework baseline requires
its registered adapter evidence. The first candidate proves the NumPy 2.1.0
floor in one compatible installed-wheel environment; it does not claim every
NumPy version by CPython-version combination has been tested.

## Pre-1.0 compatibility and deprecation

Before 1.0, public Python names and behavior may change between minor releases,
but not silently within a released artifact. When practical, a renamed or
replaced public API remains available for at least one subsequent prerelease
and emits `DeprecationWarning` with the replacement. Immediate removal is
reserved for security, data-integrity, or scientifically incorrect behavior
that cannot be retained safely.

[RFC 0083](../../rfcs/0083-current-model-artifact-epoch.md) authorizes one
additional exception: the bounded pre-1.0 Model and Model Transaction
compatibility epoch reset. It names every removed surface, freezes the retained
persisted contract and its exact rejection behavior, requires migration of
every live consumer, and requires the break in release notes. This one-time
exception cannot reinterpret an old identifier, silently migrate bytes, or
authorize unrelated removals.

Persisted Eqiora artifact codecs and versioned control contracts follow their
own compatibility rules. A Python package version never authorizes silent
migration, wire sniffing, or reinterpretation of those bytes.

## Yanking and security

Yank a Python release when users should not select it for new installations but
existing exact pins may still need resolution. Grounds include:

- a security vulnerability;
- data corruption or scientifically incorrect accepted output;
- a broken or materially mis-tagged wheel;
- metadata that installs an incompatible dependency set.

Publish a corrected version instead of replacing files under an existing
version. Use the private reporting path in
[`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md) for suspected vulnerabilities. Deprecation
alone is not a reason to yank, and yanking is not deletion or revocation.

Production PyPI promotion remains a separate public-release decision.
