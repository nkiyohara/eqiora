## Decision

Eqiora optimizes for **truthful product lead time**: the time from a concrete accepted outcome to
a merged, focused-tested capability whose verification status is reported independently and
honestly. It does not optimize agent utilization, document volume, open lanes, contract count,
test count, or CI activity in isolation.

AI makes implementation cheap. It does not make context, integration, compatibility, scientific
evidence, or human attention free. Process and abstraction therefore need the same deletion
pressure as production code.

The default development path is one primary agent, one local change, the narrowest useful
check, one self-review, and stop. The same primary agent owns implementation through pull
request integration. Durable scientific, compatibility, artifact, security, release, CI,
governance, and architecture risk keeps its applicable existing evidence and focused review,
without requiring a second actor. Nothing else inherits that ceremony by analogy.

## Product position

Eqiora aims to make computational engineering capabilities machine-checkable end to end, with
narrow claims and independently truthful verification status. Performance claims remain
workload-specific and bind
hardware, mesh, ordering, solver, preconditioner, tolerances, transfer accounting, warmup, and
repetitions.

Machine-checkability does not mean every implementation receives a new schema, proof framework,
registry, or exact-byte oracle. A focused test at an existing typed boundary is the normal
evidence for ordinary behavior. Independent scientific derivation and exact-artifact oracles
remain exceptional because their failure cost is durable.

Generated or hand-written physics must not create a bespoke proof system per module. Prefer
existing compiler, realization, and evidence paths when they genuinely reduce repeated
invariant-bearing formulas. Do not build a universal form, plugin, or intermediate
representation before a current capability and a second real consumer show the need.

## Evidence development freeze

As of 2026-08-25, evidence development is frozen. Preserve and run the accepted evidence, but
do not add or extend verification cases, scientific or exact-artifact oracles, expected values,
tolerances, falsifiers, exact inventories, evidence schemas, evidence projections, or bespoke
evidence infrastructure. Do not update a frozen expectation to follow implementation output.

The freeze is not a product-development or test freeze. New product behavior uses ordinary
focused behavior, compatibility, and failure tests. The capability matrix records the resulting
contract and execution truth, but verification remains absent unless unchanged pre-freeze
evidence already proves the exact claim. When frozen evidence disagrees with a candidate, fix
the product or build reproducibility, narrow the claim, or leave the capability unverified.
Only an explicit owner instruction may unfreeze a named evidence scope.

## Context scales by navigation

Large repositories stay usable when agents can find the right context without loading all
context at once.

- Keep root `AGENTS.md` short and repository-wide.
- Put path-specific instructions only near code that repeatedly needs different rules.
- Treat documentation as a map to source, tests, manifests, and decisions, not as a copy of
  them.
- State each instruction once in its authoritative owner and link to it.
- Start with the goal, domain context, hard constraints, approval boundaries, and success
  criteria. Let the agent discover implementation details from the repository.
- Expose or invoke only tools relevant to the current task; unused tools and instructions
  consume attention.
- Record what was not checked. Confidence is not evidence.

Add a skill only for a repeatable workflow with reusable instructions or assets. Add an MCP or
other protocol only for a real external system boundary. A one-off repository task needs
neither.

Subagents spend additional context and tokens. Prefer them for independent, read-heavy, or
noisy exploration whose outputs can be summarized. Keep ordinary writable work with one agent;
parallel writes require disjoint ownership and an integration benefit greater than their merge
cost.

## Architecture discipline

Choose the smallest design that closes the current claim:

- use an existing type before adding a wrapper or translation layer;
- use a private helper before a public abstraction;
- require a current invariant owner and real consumer;
- keep semantic identity, execution provenance, and presentation state separate;
- do not move branching, configuration, or validation into every consumer;
- split oversized implementation files instead of raising ceilings; and
- delete speculative pilots when their second consumer or measured benefit does not arrive.

An architecture check must protect a plausible defect in a current supported surface.
Private source layout is not a product artifact. Line, token, complexity, or public-surface
ratchets may prevent unreviewable code, but each ceiling is debt: it needs a current reason,
must not rise through ordinary work, and should disappear when a simpler invariant replaces it.

## Evidence discipline

Evidence should be cheaper than the mistake it prevents.

- Run accepted cases without changing their claim, oracle, expected result, tolerance, or
  falsifier.
- Treat an accepted case as support only for its explicit claim and non-claims.
- Use focused tests for new ordinary behavior; do not register them as evidence.
- Do not generalize a result across environments, caches, hosts, or aborted runs.
- Fix nondeterministic product or build output rather than teaching an exact oracle to accept it.
- Narrow or mark a claim unverified when frozen evidence cannot support it.

## Process deletion rules

Before retaining a document, gate, review, receipt, template, or coordination step, name:

1. the current decision it can change or plausible defect it can expose;
2. the authority that does not already carry the same fact; and
3. the condition under which it will be deleted.

Delete or consolidate it when those answers are absent. Historical RFCs may preserve decisions,
but active instructions must not route ordinary work through superseded process. Do not create
a replacement document merely to narrate the deletion.

The following are regressions unless they replace more durable complexity than they add:

- a giant integration pull request used as a coordination mechanism;
- a risk-classifier framework for rules that fit in a short list;
- prose copies of paths, hashes, manifests, evidence indices, or GitHub relations;
- permanent actor identities or receipts without an adversarial trust boundary;
- a new orchestration layer to work around build, cache, sync, or editor limits; and
- mandatory broad verification after a focused check already answers the integration question.

## Evaluation and amendment

Use real delivery failures to amend the strategy. Useful observations include capability lead
time, first-pass success, correction cycles, integration conflicts, escaped defects, and
repeated verification work. They are diagnostic, not standing reporting requirements.

Change one rule only when an observed failure can distinguish the new rule from the current
one. Remove the superseded rule in the same change. A failed experiment is deleted rather than
kept as optional architecture.

## Research basis

The 2026-08-22 revision applies current official guidance for
[Codex AGENTS.md](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md),
[Codex subagents](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents), and
[lean GPT-5.6 prompting](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model).
These sources inform the context and orchestration rules; repository evidence remains the
authority for Eqiora-specific decisions.
