# Finite component spaces and maps

This section of the [target specification](core.md) chooses one source spelling for the
finite-space owner. The [two-state specimen](finite-state.md) exercises it; these constructs
are not yet compiler admission claims.

## Declarations and types

```eqiora
space Levels = orthonormal(ground, excited);
space Channels = orthonormal(command, feedback);
space Joint = product(Levels, Channels);

variable amplitude: coordinates<complex<1>, Levels>;
variable channels: coordinates<V, Channels>;
parameter coupling: map<complex<J>, Levels, Levels> =
  linear_map(Levels, Levels, [[0 [J], 2 [J]], [2 [J], 0 [J]]]);
```

`space name = orthonormal(label, ...);` declares a nonempty, finite, ordered orthonormal basis
with nominal declaration identity. Labels are unique identifiers. The written label order is
the coordinate order; file traversal and symbol-resolution order cannot alter it. Equal labels
and extent in another declaration do not establish the same space.

`space name = product(space, space, ...);` names an ordered tensor product of at least two
spaces. The name is an alias for the factor expression, not a new independent basis. Factor
order and nesting are retained; changing either requires an explicit admitted transformation.
For two factors the right factor varies fastest. `Joint` therefore orders pairs as
`(ground, command)`, `(ground, feedback)`, `(excited, command)`, `(excited, feedback)`.
A repeated factor retains distinct positions. Product extent is checked before expansion.

| Type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `coordinates<S, B>` | Coordinates with scalar type `S` in space `B` |
| `coordinates<S, dual<B>>` | Linear dual coordinates, not implicit conjugation |
| `map<S, A, B>` | Linear map from `A` to `B`, whose matrix coefficients have scalar type `S` |

For coordinates, `S` may also be `integer`, retaining exact signed components without a
physical dimension. Maps in this catalog retain real or complex coefficients; admitting
integer coordinates does not establish integer map execution.
For continuous values, `S` is a real dimension or `complex<dimension>`. A map's coefficient dimension multiplies
the input coordinate dimension. For example, applying `map<J, Levels, Levels>` to dimensionless
coordinates returns energy-valued coordinates. The scalar domain embeds real into complex
when needed; it never discards an imaginary component.

An orthonormal declaration fixes its mathematical inner product, not a physical metric inferred
from an arbitrary array. Nonorthogonal metrics require their own admitted contract and reject
until supported. Numerical finite-element bases remain Realization data and are not declared
as these physical component spaces.

## Values and operations

`coordinates(B, [values])` explicitly constructs coordinates in `B`; `linear_map(A, B, rows)`
constructs a map from `A` to `B`. Map rows follow the target basis and columns the source basis.
These constructors consume exactly the declared extents. Nested array literals are input
syntax, not implicit array-to-space coercions. Their elements obey the common type rules.

For an atomic labeled space, `value.label` selects its coordinate. Product coordinates use
`coordinate(value, [factor indexes])`, with one zero-based index per atomic factor in the
declared product structure. Both access forms preserve the scalar dimension and domain.
Out-of-range or structurally mismatched selectors reject.

| Operation | Type and convention |
|---|---|
| `apply(M, x)` | Requires `x` in the exact source space of `M`; result is in its target |
| `compose(M, N)` | Apply `N` first, then `M`; the middle spaces must match exactly |
| `identity(B)` | Dimensionless real identity map on `B` |
| `inner(x, y)` | Same space; sum of `conj(x_j) * y_j` in the declared orthonormal basis |
| `pair(d, x)` | Linear evaluation of a dual coordinate on its exact primal space, without conjugation |
| `transpose(M)` | Map from the target dual to the source dual, without conjugation |
| `adjoint(M)` | Map from target to source using their admitted inner products; conjugate transpose here |
| `tensor_product(M, N)` | Map between the ordered products of the source and target factors |
| `permute_factors(x, permutation)` | Explicit coordinate permutation, retaining the reordered product type |

For vectors, `tensor_product(x, y)` produces coordinates in the ordered product space with
component `x_i * y_j`, using the same right-factor-fastest convention. It is not an outer map
with an implicitly conjugated second operand. A map transpose changes dual roles; an adjoint
does not arise just because a renderer swaps row and column labels.

Products multiply dimensions and addition requires equal dimensions and exact spaces.
No operation uses a same-sized spatial vector or raw array as a substitute. Finite products,
selectors, and permutations have static bounded extents; runtime state cannot grow topology.

## Exact counts and signed changes

`counts<Species>` retains an atomic Space's exact identity and ordered labels, together with
nonnegative particle cardinalities. `counts(Species, [values])` checks the exact cardinality
and signed-integer bounds; it does not coerce an array or floating-point value into a count.
The Space has no inferred chemical formula, charge or conservation law.

```eqiora
space Species = orthonormal(A, B);

model Transfer() {
  clock tick = periodic(1[s], phase = 0[s]);
  state population: counts<Species> at tick;
  parameter change: coordinates<integer, Species> = coordinates(Species, [-1, 1]);
  initial {
    population = counts(Species, [2, 9007199254740993]);
  }
  relation transfer at tick {
    next(population) = pre(population) + change;
  }
}
```

Count plus signed coordinates produces counts only for the exact same atomic Space. All
components are staged and checked before any accepted state changes. The example's first
two updates are `[1, 9007199254740994]` and `[0, 9007199254740995]`; the third update rejects
underflow and preserves the second accepted state and tick. Same labels or extent in another
Space do not grant compatibility. Reordering labels changes coordinate meaning rather than
silently reordering the values.

This bounded path represents one inspectable signed stoichiometric column. It does not
establish full map algebra, reaction conservation metadata, stochastic sampling or a
count-to-amount/concentration conversion. Those require their explicit owners and evidence.

## Compact grammar

```text
space-decl = "space" name [notation] "=" space-definition ";"
space-definition = "orthonormal" "(" name {"," name} ")"
                 | "product" "(" space-ref "," space-ref {"," space-ref} ")"
space-ref = qualified-name | "dual" "<" space-ref ">"
coordinate-type = "coordinates" "<" scalar-type "," space-ref ">"
map-type = "map" "<" scalar-type "," space-ref "," space-ref ">"
```

There is no `on` or `at` on a space declaration: support and activation qualify values using
the space, not the basis identity. Space declarations participate in ordinary module visibility,
forward resolution, duplicate-name checks, and cycle rejection. Product aliases do not bypass
the same finite expansion limits used for arrays and families.
