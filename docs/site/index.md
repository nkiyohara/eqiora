# Model meaning once. Realize it many ways.

Eqiora is an open-source, meaning-first foundation for scientific modeling,
simulation, differentiation, and execution.

Its central boundary is simple:

> A model states typed mathematical relations. A realization chooses how those
> relations are discretized, solved, and executed.

That separation lets block diagrams, acausal physical networks, PDE fields,
hybrid dynamics, and reusable components share one canonical meaning without
making a numerical method or hardware backend part of the model.

!!! note "Alpha 0.1.0a1"
    Eqiora is alpha research software under active development. The
    [capability matrix](capabilities.md) and generated
    [verification guide](evidence/index.md) bound what is currently supported;
    this site does not widen those claims.
