# Poisson FEM/FVM convergence evidence

This verified case tests canonical coordinate-dependent spatial meaning and
the realization contracts together.

## Problem

```text
-u'' = pi^2 sin(pi x),  x in (0, 1)
u(0) = u(1) = 0
u_exact(x) = sin(pi x)
```

The Eqiora Language model stores the manufactured source as
`source_scale * math.sin(wave_number * coordinate(0))`. Compilation and semantic
validation produce one dimension-aware expression DAG; spatial lowering
produces one immutable scalar tape evaluated by both methods.

Both methods use the same `LineMesh` revision, four-point Gauss–Legendre cell
quadrature, constraint-aware `CooAssembler`, finalized CSR matrix,
backend-neutral `SolverPlan`, deterministic reference CG backend, and
four-point `L2` error quadrature. CSR implements the same allocation-free
`LinearOperator` contract used by production adapters. Acceptance uses an
independently recomputed true residual, not only the recursive CG residual.

- FEM: continuous linear vertex basis, cell stiffness/load operators.
- FVM: cell-centered unknowns, cell source operator, interior/boundary
  two-point facet flux operators.
- Evidence view: native FEM interpolation and an explicitly declared linear
  FVM reconstruction through boundary and cell-center values. Global balance
  uses FEM endpoint reactions or FVM outward boundary fluxes plus the same
  quadrature-integrated source.

CI requires strictly decreasing errors, every reported order to exceed `1.9`,
and both relative global balance defects to remain below `2e-12`. Reproduce
the numerical table with:

```bash
cargo run -p eqiora-numerics --example poisson_convergence
```

The separate
[`numerics.linear-backends`](../../verify/numerics/linear-backends/README.md)
case solves the same canonical revision through the reference and faer
backends. That case verifies adapter equivalence and true-residual acceptance;
it does not broaden this one-dimensional spatial claim.

## Claim boundary

The canonical Cartesian Domain, coordinate operator, expression shape, mesh,
geometry-map, reference-cell, quadrature, local-operator, and assembly
contracts carry explicit runtime dimensions. A five-dimensional tensor-product
quadrature is tested independently.

The `LineMesh` and both numerical realizations in this evidence are 1D. The
spatial expression tape and scalar elliptic Cartesian lowerer are now
runtime-dimensional, but that later generalization does not retroactively
widen this case. Independent 2D end-to-end evidence is recorded in
[`cartesian-poisson-fem-fvm.md`](cartesian-poisson-fem-fvm.md). Vector/tensor
fields, mixed/high-order elements, unstructured/adaptive meshes, and 3D
realization remain separate obligations.
