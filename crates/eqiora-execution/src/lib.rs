//! **eqiora-execution** — deployment binding and accepted execution shape.
//!
//! This first bounded slice binds one accepted host placement from a
//! [`eqiora_realization::PortableRealizationGraph`] to an existing
//! [`eqiora_solver::ExecutionReport`]. It then seals one exact canonical CSR
//! system and admits a receipt only after the resulting [`eqiora_solver::SolveReport`]
//! is independently rechecked against that same system. The solver-native
//! verifier remains visible in its report; the receipt records its additional
//! serial-host replay separately.
//!
//! The public lifecycle is intentionally one-way:
//!
//! ```text
//! PortableRealizationGraph -> DeploymentBinding -> AdmittedExecution
//!     -> accepted LinearSolution -> ExecutionReceipt -> ExecutionDagView
//! ```
//!
//! There is no mutable public graph builder, raw node identity, arbitrary
//! action payload, or target cross product. Transfer, halo, collective, and
//! device completion nodes enter only with their first executable consumer.
//! Raw admission is an adapter contract and is intentionally absent from the
//! curated `eqiora` facade; ordinary applications receive only read-only
//! receipts produced after an equation-aware numerical finalizer has replayed
//! the exact portable graph.
