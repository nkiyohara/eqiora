//! **eqiora-sem** — the reference interpreter for the semantic kernel
//! (Layer L2).
//!
//! This crate is the **semantic oracle**: small, slow, obviously correct.
//! The normative meaning of an Eqiora program is "the language spec plus the
//! behavior of this interpreter". Every optimized execution path — compiler,
//! GPU backends, distributed runtime, fixed-step codegen — must match this
//! crate within the numerical contract, never the other way around.
//!
//! Standing rules for contributors:
//!
//! - **No optimizations. Ever.** Clarity beats speed here by design; the
//!   target size is a few thousand lines one person can read end to end.
//! - Kernel concepts only: Domain, Representation, Field, Parameter,
//!   Port, Relation, Activation, Connection, ClockDomain. Standard-ontology
//!   named-subgraph views select and organize kernel nodes but are ignored by
//!   interpretation after that selection; they never acquire node semantics.
//! - When this crate and the spec text disagree, an RFC decides which is
//!   right, and both get fixed.
