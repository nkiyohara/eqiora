/// Validate the external links in one distributed spatial artifact content DAG.
///
/// This check proves exact content linkage from the run through its
/// Realization and Model, and from that Realization through the distributed
/// layout to its complete system and unique-owner partition. The returned
/// system is freshly reconstructed from the linked complete algebra and owner
/// map; callers can reuse it for later admission instead of deriving the
/// layout a second time.
///
/// This artifact-layer check deliberately does not prove that `system` was
/// lowered from `model` under `realization`. Semantic derivation replay belongs
/// in the public facade integration, where the canonical lowerer is available.
/// In particular, the admitted spatial dimension is not the algebraic degree-
/// of-freedom count and can only be rechecked against the replayed mesh and
/// lowering, while this function proves the system/partition algebraic
/// dimension agreement.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns `EQ0901` if any content identity, typed model identity, semantic
/// revision, distributed requirement, algebraic shape/scalar, derived layout,
/// execution partition count, target, worker count, or reduction policy is
/// inconsistent.
