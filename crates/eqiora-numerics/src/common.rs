//! Numerical contracts shared by more than one scientific family.
//!
//! This namespace is intentionally narrow: it owns meshes, discrete spaces
//! and shared Field representations, boundary classification, local operators,
//! assembled linearization, design coordinates, scalar spatial expressions,
//! and validated step counts. A contract that belongs to one scientific
//! family stays with that family.
