# CubeCL local-action experiment

This unpublished workspace evaluates Eqiora's `LocalLinearActionIr` against
CubeCL without adding CubeCL to the production dependency graph.

The current result is a failed graduation gate, not GPU support. CubeCL 0.10.0
does not advertise ordinary `f64` buffers/arithmetic for its shared CUDA/HIP
C++ backend, so Eqiora rejects the runtime before allocation. The experiment
uses Rust 1.92 or newer because the pinned dependency graph requires it; the
production workspace remains Rust 1.89.

Run the device-independent contract tests with:

```console
cargo +1.92.0 test --manifest-path experiments/cubecl-local-action/Cargo.toml --locked
```

Run the physical capability gates with exactly one visible device:

```console
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 cargo +1.92.0 test \
  --manifest-path experiments/cubecl-local-action/Cargo.toml \
  --locked --features cuda --test conformance -- --ignored

HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 cargo +1.92.0 test \
  --manifest-path experiments/cubecl-local-action/Cargo.toml \
  --locked --features hip --test conformance -- --ignored
```

The CUDA test currently expects `MissingF64Capability`. The HIP test has not
been run on physical AMD hardware. Do not weaken either case to `f32`; mixed
precision requires a separate Realization and error contract.
