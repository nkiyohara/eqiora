## 🔬 See the physics

**Pressure around a circular obstacle.** This steady-Stokes example starts with
an exact geometry and a mathematical model, then produces a pressure field,
boundary forces, and fluxes with Python.

## ✨ Why Eqiora?

Eqiora is being built around a simple kind of freedom: describe the physics you
care about, combine the models you need, and use the numerical methods that fit
the problem.

- **🌐 One language across physics.** Bring fields, equations, physical
  connections, continuous dynamics, and discrete events into a common
  mathematical model.
- **🔗 Coupling belongs in the model.** Make interactions explicit, from
  connected components to strongly coupled systems whose unknowns must be
  solved together.
- **🛠️ Space for your own numerical methods.** Separate what the equations
  mean from how they are solved—the foundation for changing discretizations,
  integrating a custom solver, or developing a new method.
- **🧮 Mathematics you can read.** Express quantities, units, equations, and
  boundary conditions in Eqiora's domain-specific language (`.eqi`). Keep the
  assumptions visible to the people who read, review, and extend a model.
- **🧩 Models that grow with your work.** Reuse components and constitutive
  laws, compose them into larger systems, and replace individual parts as your
  research or application evolves.
- **🐍 A natural home for computational experiments.** Use Python to build
  geometry, mesh, run simulations, inspect NumPy field data, and make plots.
  Connect the same workflow to your experiment scripts and analysis tools.
- **🦀 Native execution, one shared core.** Python and Rust applications share
  the same mathematical model and execution foundations. Numerical backends
  live alongside that model, keeping physical definitions separate from
  implementation choices.
- **🔎 Calculations you can inspect.** Type and dimension checks catch model
  inconsistencies; explicit plans and typed outputs connect each result to its
  equations, geometry, mesh, and solver settings. Follow examples into their
  source and checks.

## 🚀 Get started with uv

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed,
create a project with meshing and plotting support:

```console
uv init --python ">=3.11,<3.15" eqiora-demo
cd eqiora-demo
uv add "eqiora[gmsh,matplotlib]==0.1.0a9"
```

The published wheels support **ordinary-GIL CPython 3.11–3.14 on Linux x86-64
(manylinux)**. Gmsh also needs the system OpenGL runtime; see the
[installation guide](https://eqiora.org/get-started/) for setup details.

Save the example below as `cylinder.py`, then run:

```console
uv run cylinder.py
```

It prints pressure, cylinder force, and net flux, then saves `pressure.png`.

## 🧩 From a model to a result

The model describes the mathematics. A resolved **Plan** records the numerical
choices. A **Result** carries the outputs and diagnostics of that run.

```text
Equations + Geometry   →   Model   →   Plan   →   Result
                          compile     resolve    run
                                      ↑
                              Mesh · Method · Solver
```

This separation keeps the physical model readable while you experiment with
discretizations and solver policies. Fields and diagnostics remain connected to
the choices that produced them.
Explore the [architecture](docs/architecture.md) for how the pieces fit.

## 🦀 Use from Rust

Add the published facade to a Cargo project:

```console
cargo add eqiora@=0.1.0-alpha.9
```

Start with the [Rust guide](docs/rust-api.md) for model compilation and optional
backends, or browse the [API docs](https://docs.rs/eqiora/0.1.0-alpha.9/eqiora/).

## 🌱 Growing in the open

Eqiora is **alpha research software**. The current release covers focused paths
through hybrid execution, scalar FEM/FVM, fluid flow, elasticity, implicit
differentiation, and selected CPU/CUDA/MPI adapters. Consult the
[capability matrix](docs/capability-matrix.md) for each method and environment,
and the [benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md) for reproduced results.

Pre-1.0 APIs evolve without compatibility shims. Eqiora is not certified for
safety-critical or production engineering decisions.
