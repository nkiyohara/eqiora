# Port-closed coherent-SI MINI Stokes

This case verifies RFC 0046's first executable fluid boundary. The exact
`Eqiora.Mechanics.Interfaces@0.1.0` package owns one nominal velocity/traction
Connector and zero terminals. The exact
`Eqiora.Fluid.Incompressible@0.2.0` package depends on it and binds the complete
exterior velocity trace and parent-outward Newtonian traction to those Ports.

The direct fixture writes four `trace(velocity) = 0` Relations. The packaged
fixture connects four generated fluid Ports to `ZeroVelocity2d` terminals.
After ordinary package elaboration, the same name-independent Stokes lowerer
must report `TraceZero` on the corresponding axis/side roles. Both Models then
use the existing exact Field-wise v2 plan, coherent-SI normalization, MINI
assembly, reference MINRES, and physical reconstruction. The test requires
equal canonical CSR/RHS data and equal physical velocity, pressure, gauge,
force, and reaction evidence.

The root dynamic-viscosity Parameter is forwarded unchanged into both the
volume and boundary Component slots; elaboration does not fabricate
occurrence-local Parameters. Direct and exact-package coefficient expressions
agree in primal evaluation, forward JVP, and evaluated reverse-mode VJP. A
boundary law bound to a separately declared Parameter is rejected even when
its current value is equal to the volume coefficient. [RFC
0055](../../../rfcs/0055-component-parameter-terms.md) records this identity
rule.

Near-miss variants also replace the shared viscosity direction with an
equal-valued independent Parameter, one terminal with `ZeroTraction2d`, or a
compatible unresolved Port. Canonical lowering rejects the independent
coefficient and must retain `FluxZero` or `PortBinding` for the boundary
variants;
RFC 0047 makes `FluxZero` the exact zero normal-pressure case and therefore
selects an empty pressure-constraint list. The live Port must still fail before
inspecting a supplied invalid mesh. This ordering prevents unresolved coupling
from being silently interpreted as either zero velocity or zero traction.

Run:

```bash
cargo test --locked -p eqiora --test port_closed_si_mini_stokes_2d
cargo run --locked -p eqiora-verify -- run --case fluid.port-closed-si-mini-stokes-2d
```

This evidence does not claim a general natural/open-boundary solve, live Port
or trace transfer, nonzero boundary data, fluid-fluid coupling, a solid velocity law,
displacement-to-velocity conversion, structural dynamics, ALE, or FSI.
