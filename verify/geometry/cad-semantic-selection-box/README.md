# CAD semantic selection over one bounded box workflow

This case proves the first intentionally narrow CAD vertical slice without
making CAD-kernel topology part of Eqiora's meaning. One exact millimetre STEP
cuboid is imported through the isolated Truck adapter. A fully constrained XY
rectangle is extruded and intersected with that stock. The result must equal
one exact three-dimensional Cartesian Semantic Domain.

The accepted chain is content-bound from Model and complete source bytes
through CAD design/build evidence, Geometry Identity, a deterministic
six-tetrahedron mesh, and ordinary geometry-to-mesh correspondence. Build
evidence records the exact adapter/kernel versions, three normalized closed
six-plane observations, separate source/modeling/classification tolerances,
and an explicit no-repair disposition. Raw Truck faces, ordering, and objects
never cross the adapter seam.

Application viewport triangles and semantic-table rows both create the same request:
`(Geometry Identity digest, Domain ID)`. The resolved selection exposes exact
body/boundary geometry, mesh membership, applied Relations, and
boundary-physical Ports. Renderer-local triangle indices cannot be used as
selection identity. A changed geometry revision rejects the old request.

Cross-revision retention uses the existing exact geometry-revision association
artifact over two independently accepted plans. Selection retention succeeds
only through its total one-to-one successor relation; a selection from any
other revision fails closed. Dimension-edit transaction preview and commit are
not claimed. The separately
registered
[`geometry.fixed-reference-interface-identity-2d`](../fixed-reference-interface-identity-2d/README.md)
case owns the missing, split, merged, and ambiguous association falsifiers that
this CAD path reuses.

The registered Rust target also rejects changed/truncated STEP bytes, unit and
CAD-policy drift, adapter identity substitution, open or multiple solids,
non-planar faces, non-axis-aligned box topology, stale selection, and foreign
regeneration revisions. Repair and raw kernel-face selection are stronger
type-level exclusions: V1 has no repaired disposition or public face-rank field
that a caller could submit.

Studio has a native bridge over the same public plan and a closed CAD
sub-protocol. Its local native, TypeScript, and Playwright suites check stale
requests, unknown fields, keyboard table/viewport parity, responsive layout,
and accessibility. Those UI checks are local Studio validation; they are not
an additional Cargo evidence target in the root registry. This case's
registered claim stops at the canonical application projection.

Run:

```bash
cargo test --locked -p eqiora --features cad-truck --test cad_semantic_selection
cargo run --locked -p eqiora-verify -- run --case geometry.cad-semantic-selection-box
```

This case does not claim general STEP/assembly support, curved topology,
healing, a general Boolean kernel, persistent B-rep schemas, universal topology
naming, a general CAD editor, additional feature types, ALE, or remeshing.
