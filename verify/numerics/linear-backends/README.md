# Linear backend verification

This case checks that one Eqiora-owned `SolverPlan` and `LinearOperator`
contract can drive the independent reference and faer adapters without moving
backend types into canonical model or spatial APIs.

The executable evidence includes:

- reference CG and faer CG agreement on a symmetric positive-definite system;
- faer BiCGSTAB on a nonsymmetric manufactured system;
- Faer partial-pivot sparse LU on a precommitted exact-rational,
  non-structurally-symmetric canonical CSR system;
- zero-work acceptance of the exact initial guess, one factor-and-solve attempt
  for the ordinary path, and fail-closed handling of one inconsistent
  rank-deficient system;
- exact capability admission for General, symmetric-positive-definite, and
  symmetric-indefinite operators with only Identity, Fast, and `f64`;
- rejection of matrix-free or hand-built `LinearProblem` values without the
  same captured canonical CSR owner;
- identity and Jacobi adapter actions;
- one exact faer 0.24.4 provider release bound before execution and retained
  consistently by the producer report and accepted execution receipt;
- independent `||b - A x||_2` acceptance through the Eqiora operator;
- explicit rejection of a reproducible-reduction request that faer does not
  currently guarantee; and
- the same canonical Poisson model revision solved by reference and faer.

The sparse-LU path converts validated row-major storage to the same mathematical
column-major matrix, then calls Faer low-level symbolic, numeric, and solve APIs.
Numeric factorization and solve receive `Par::Seq` explicitly; process-global
parallelism wrappers are structurally excluded. Eqiora replays the true residual
through its own operator before accepting the returned values.

The claim is host-local, `f64`, replicated, normal-orientation, captured-CSR,
Identity, Fast, and single-worker. It is not a matrix-free, transpose,
threaded, distributed, accelerator, Realization-admission, performance, scale,
fill, memory, pseudo-inverse, least-squares, or singularity-diagnosis claim.

```bash
cargo test -p eqiora-backend-faer

cargo run -p eqiora-verify -- run --case numerics.linear-backends

## Pre-committed sparse-LU evidence

`expected/sparse-lu-contract.json` and `oracle/sparse_lu_oracle.py` freeze the
exact-rational oracle for the proposed `SparseLu` direct algorithm under the
`SolverPlan` contract of
[RFC 0010](../../../rfcs/0010-execution-backend-contracts.md). They were written
by an agent that does not implement the slice, before any implementation
existed, and later amended by that same agent to bind the acceptance threshold
the implementer is not permitted to author. Neither the original nor the
amendment read, ran, or saw any implementation.

The registered Rust target invokes this exact Python oracle with the frozen
digest, then consumes the same JSON fixture for its CSR, RHS, expected solution,
capability tuples, plan tolerances, error ceiling, and early-exit boundary.
Neither the implementation nor its Rust test owns those values.

```bash
python3 verify/numerics/linear-backends/oracle/sparse_lu_oracle.py --summary
```

See [the oracle reference](references/sparse-lu-oracle.md) for the witnesses,
the falsifiers, the acceptance threshold and the plan it binds, the fixture
digest, and the nonclaims.
