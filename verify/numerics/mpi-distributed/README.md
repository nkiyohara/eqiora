# MPI distributed verification

This registered case runs one captured complete-CSR system
through an arbitrary-owner distributed layout with one, two, and four MPI
ranks on one host. Collective admission seals the complete verifier, system,
layout, and sole solver plan only after all dynamic execution workspace exists.
The transport-neutral source first derives exact checked allocation extents,
owns each canonical local layout once, and deterministically forms halo groups
from sorted `(owner, receiver, index)` triples. Shards borrow that sole layout
beside their owned-row CSR storage.

All later status records carry an exact phase, iteration, and monotonic
ordinal. The public adapter exposes no unadmitted raw apply, dot, or solve
operation. Rank-order explicit global-index blocks drive the uninterrupted
index/value gather pair, and every rank independently reaccepts and compares
the same complete vector and report.

The admitted solver executes both numerical policies at every rank count.
Reproducible dot products all-gather one partial per rank and fold them in rank
order. Fast dot products use the MPI implementation's native all-reduce. Both
plans solve the same manufactured SPD system with Jacobi preconditioning and
must pass complete-host residual acceptance.

Test-only hooks inject plan, Jacobi, local-action, producer, gather, and host
verifier failures after successful admission. A parent process enforces a
timeout and checks a common diagnostic at one, two, and four ranks.

This case supplies bounded C/X/V for the generic algebra bridge. It does not
execute canonical FEM/FVM lowering or finish, typed durable distributed
artifacts, physical multi-node bridge placement, scalability,
checkpoint/restart, or process-failure recovery. Earlier physical two-node
evidence covers the lower-level halo/reduction/CG case only.
