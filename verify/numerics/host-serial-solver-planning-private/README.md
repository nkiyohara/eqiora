# Private host-serial solver-planning falsifiers

This required companion to
[`numerics.host-serial-solver-planning`](../host-serial-solver-planning/README.md)
selects one exact `eqiora-solver` library-test aggregator. The public case owns
the three live backend executions and public observations. This private case
owns the complete adversarial catalog, control, profile, capability, reranking,
problem-identity, zero-work, and exactly-once checks. The capability is verified
only when both cases pass.

The aggregator directly executes every private check. Candidate rejection
freezes the complete candidate-ID-ordered reason trace and exact remaining
selection for Robust, Fast, and LowMemory. All nonempty admitted subsets are
covered. One faer BiCGSTAB mutation makes both its evidence identity and
provider descriptor stale, and every objective must still record only
`catalog.evidence-mismatch` before reranking; a provider-first validator fails
the complete trace. Capability mutations independently change algorithm, operator
properties, preconditioner, reduction, and scalar. Provider equality retains
the exact ordered real one-member faer dependency inventory; no artificial
two-member reorder surrogate exists.

Every catalog, control, profile, and capability rejection retains zero selected
and unselected backend solve calls and zero total `apply`/`diagonal` calls on
the exact owned `CanonicalCsrSystemView` installed in the resolved problem.
Each canonical fixture attaches its own test-only ledger before constructing
the planning problem, directly calls `problem.operator().apply` and
`.diagonal` once as a self-control, proves both calls were observed, and resets
before resolution. The missing, duplicate, unknown, relative-tolerance-bit,
absolute-tolerance-bit, and iteration-limit preflights all use that exact
instrumented canonical operator rather than a hand-built surrogate. Distinct
ledgers isolate parallel tests; source-storage counters are separately reset
after legitimate capture. Transposed hand-built input must reject, but this
oracle does not choose between the simultaneous
`profile.normal-required` and `profile.canonical-csr-required` sub-gates.

For successful and failing execution, every objective records exactly one call
to its selected backend, zero calls to both unselected backends, no retry or
fallback, no plan mutation, the address of the exact `LinearProblem` borrowed
at resolution, and the identity of its exact owned canonical operator. The
successful fake backend delegates true-residual acceptance through the supplied
execution and exact resolved problem operator: the reset actual-operator ledger
therefore records exactly two total `apply` calls (initial and final residual)
and zero `diagonal` calls. Selected failure records zero total actual-operator
`apply` and `diagonal` calls. One extra direct call through
`decision.problem().operator()` would therefore falsify either exact total.

Run the paired evidence with:

```console
cargo run --locked -p eqiora-verify -- run \
  --case numerics.host-serial-solver-planning \
  --case numerics.host-serial-solver-planning-private
```

At the frozen preimplementation revision, `planning.rs` and its crate-root test
wiring do not exist. The public integration target therefore fails at the
absent planning API, and this exact library selector fails closed because the
aggregator is absent. These are the intentional red boundaries until production
and integration-owned wiring are composed. This private case adds no public
surface or product capability.
