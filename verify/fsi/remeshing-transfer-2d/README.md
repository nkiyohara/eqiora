# Conservative ALE FSI remesh transfer in 2D

Status: verified for the bounded serial-host 2D slice below.

This case closes the first topology-changing continuation slice from [RFC
0065](../../../rfcs/0065-remeshing-correspondence-and-transfer.md). One accepted
moving FSI state crosses a zero-model-time remesh seam between two affine
triangle revisions with different vertex, cell, and interface-facet counts.
The canonical Model and semantic GeometryIdentity do not change.

The source and target meshes share neither an index correspondence nor a
one-to-one tessellation. The target uses independently connected centered
body-wise fans rather than a copied structured-grid connectivity; shared
coordinates remain geometry and never become implicit mesh identity. The
material-solid and current-spatial-fluid common refinements both contain source
cells split across target cells and target cells assembled from multiple source
cells. The old two-facet interface is replaced by a four-facet interface while
retaining every source P1 trace kink. This makes the case a topology-changing
transfer witness, not a renumbering or diagonal-flip example.

## Verified evidence

The Cargo integration target executes the complete vertical slice:

- direct canonical V5 lowering and independent source/target Realization
  resolution;
- one accepted source step whose MINI bubble, nonconstant absolute pressure,
  shared velocity, and material displacement are all nonzero;
- a target interface that refines every source trace breakpoint, while the
  non-nested volume grids still force genuine many-to-many overlap;
- absolute solid-displacement projection in the material chart, followed by
  derivation of target harmonic geometry;
- one coupled velocity projection using current-spatial fluid integration and
  material solid integration, with shared and exterior trace defects recorded
  separately;
- absolute-pressure projection without gauge recentering;
- independent replay of projection residuals, weak incompressibility, total
  momentum, pressure moment, displacement trace, and harmonic geometry;
- independent assembly and solve-report replay under two distinct L/U/P
  computational scale profiles, with the same overlap connectivity and
  physical constraint roles/counts satisfying each profile's dimensionless
  acceptance contracts; their physical Fields are compared in common L/U/P
  units against the case manifest's non-semantic observation bound, without
  claiming bit-identical iteration or coefficients;
- finalization of the transferred state through the ordinary target ALE FSI
  operator and one strictly positive-time backward-Euler step; and
- a V2 immutable source trajectory prefix followed by content-addressed V3
  remesh and target-continuation segments, including canonical JSON replay.

The seam fails closed for stale or swapped mesh identity, changed semantic or
time-step identity, changed transfer policy, stale Field inventories, a
zero-duration ordinary step, a non-tip source state, or a broken target
predecessor.

This evidence is a deliberately bounded 2D affine-triangle CPU reference. It
does not claim a production remesher, an adaptive estimator, high-order or 3D
transfer, changing semantic geometry, ALE/remesh sensitivity, GPU or MPI
remeshing, durable checkpoint/restart, or process resume.

The registered scale-profile observation bound is one part per billion of the
corresponding characteristic L, U, or P value. It is a regression sensitivity
for this CPU reference case, deliberately separate from the numerical and
physical acceptance contracts and far below the slice's discretization error.
