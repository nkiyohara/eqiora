| Example | Source | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quickstart` | [`decay.eqi`](decay.eqi) | Compile one scalar decay model and run it through the common root Plan lifecycle. |
| `project-modules` | [`modules/resistor-project`](modules/resistor-project/) | Compile a directly imported public Model from a closed, portable multi-file source inventory whose `.eqi` module declarations own logical identity independently of file paths; the optional `package-filesystem` run discovers that same closure through bounded no-follow directory traversal. |
| `poisson` | [`packages/org.example.poisson`](../packages/org.example.poisson/) | Compile a 2D Poisson model and exercise its verification-only native reference solve. |
| `exact-cylinder-geometry` | [`python/exact_cylinder_geometry.py`](python/exact_cylinder_geometry.py) | From an installed `eqiora` package, author the exact rectangle-with-one-circular-hole identity and inspect its fixed-role named selections. |
| `exact-cylinder-mesh` | [`python/exact_cylinder_mesh.py`](python/exact_cylinder_mesh.py) | From an installed `eqiora` package, realize the exact cylinder source with typed Gmsh policy and inspect Rust-derived selection counts. |
| `steady-cylinder-source` | [`python/steady_cylinder_source.py`](python/steady_cylinder_source.py) | From an installed `eqiora` package, author the complete equations-only steady-cylinder Component as bounded `eqiora.lang.Source` values and emit readable deterministic `.eqi` through the same compiler ingress used by hand-written source. |
| `exact-cylinder-stokes` | [`python/exact_cylinder_stokes.py`](python/exact_cylinder_stokes.py) | From an installed `eqiora` package, define the sole concrete Geometry in Python, compile it with the shipped equations-only `.eqi` Component, resolve the common MINI/P1 and linear-solve policies, inspect immutable pressure, solver, force, and flux evidence, and optionally save the pressure through `eqiora[gmsh,matplotlib]`. |
| `transient-cylinder-wake` | [`python/transient_cylinder_wake.py`](python/transient_cylinder_wake.py) | From an installed package, compose the Python-authored cylinder Geometry, packaged steady and transient equation Components, common Mesh and typed policies, ten accepted nonzero startup States through 0.1 s, typed cell-average vorticity, and an optional caller-owned Figure. |
| `transient-cylinder-wake-colab` | [`python/transient_cylinder_wake_colab.ipynb`](python/transient_cylinder_wake_colab.ipynb) | In a clean Colab runtime, install the pinned `0.1.0a7` package from PyPI, follow the same public ten-step startup workflow, and inspect the final accepted State and caller-owned Figure. |
| `mixed-boundary-elasticity` | [`python/mixed_boundary_elasticity.py`](python/mixed_boundary_elasticity.py) | Define the sole concrete rectangle in Python, compile the shipped equations-only Component, resolve Q1 and linear-solve policies, run the common Result path, and optionally save a caller-owned deformed-field Figure. |
| `fixed-reference-fsi` | [`python/fixed_reference_fsi.py`](python/fixed_reference_fsi.py) | Author the adjacent Geometry in Python, compile the equations-only FSI Component, scope MINI/P1 and P1 to exact Model Domains, initialize four exact Fields, and run the common root Plan/State/Run lifecycle. |
| `steady-flow-past-cylinder` | [`steady-flow-past-cylinder.eqi`](steady-flow-past-cylinder.eqi), [exact geometry](steady-flow-past-cylinder.geometry.json) | Python supplies the concrete Geometry to the equations-only `.eqi`, then uses the common root Plan lifecycle. |

Examples keep the Model, typed numerical Plan, and execution visibly separate;
their mesh, discretization, solver, and placement choices remain explicit. The
exact-cylinder Stokes example uses that same common lifecycle with one bounded
Geometry, Gmsh, MINI/P1, and linear-solve configuration.

The [Poisson walkthrough](../docs/site/examples.md) explains what each stage means.

The cylinder source and Python-authored exact geometry form one checked
workflow. Its 50-chord mesh is an error-controlled realization of the exact
circle.
